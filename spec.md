*** SPECS ***

[X] Watch this video walkthrough of building a CLI Gem called Daily Deal before you begin.
    Watched all the videos provided on Learn

[X] Create a new repository on GitHub for your application, ie: name-cli-app.
    Created this: https://github.com/jessmitch42/clothing_store-cli-app
    I changed the name and ReadMe a few times while I was still figuring out what I was going to make.

[X] When you create the CLI app for your assessment, add the spec.md file from this repo to the root directory of the project, commit it to Git and push it up to GitHub.
    You are currently reading the spec.md :)

[X] Build your application. Make sure to commit early and commit often. Commit messages should be meaningful (clearly describe what you're doing in the commit) and accurate (there should be nothing in the commit that doesn't match the description in the commit message). Good rule of thumb is to commit every 3-7 mins of actual coding time. Most of your commits should have under 15 lines of code and a 2 line commit is perfectly acceptable. This is important and you'll be graded on this.
    Done-zo!!

[X] Make sure to create a good README.md with a short description, install instructions, a contributors guide and a link to the license for your code.


[X] While you're working on it, record a 30 min coding session with your favorite screen capture tool. During the session, either think out loud or not. It's up to you. You don't need to submit the video, but we may ask for it at a later time.
    Done. Saved locally if needed.


[X] Make sure to check each box in your spec.md (replace the space between the square braces with an x) and explain next to each one how you've met the requirement before you submit your project.
    Working on it!

[X] Prepare a video demo (narration helps!) describing how a user would interact with your working gem.
    https://drive.google.com/open?id=1yYIeU1OKp0SlnD2Fh6YlDWyZ8kQBvIxd (no narration.)

[X] Write a blog post about the project and process.
    http://jessmitchell.ca/blog/blog_4.html

[X] On Learn, submit links to the GitHub repository for your app, your video demo, and your blog post each to the corresponding textbox in the right rail, and hit "I'm done" to wrap it up.
    done!!
