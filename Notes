Steps taken (started Friday, November 17th):

- bundle gem install to create new gem template
- created repo "is_it_poly-cli-app" (following Learn naming convention)
- small update to ReadMe to make sure repo is set up properly on GitHub and locally
- created lib/is_it_poly/cli.rb and updated lib/is_it_poly.rb so controller class is working (following the Learn video about this)
- updated bin/is_it_poly and tested controller class to make sure the basics are working so far (they are! :) )

*** ANTI-PATTERNS VIDEO ***
1. don't "zip" info (separate arrays of data where values as certain indexes relate to same source--> should just be one object with attributes)
2. don't scrape site multiple times if you can get all the info you need the first time (if you're scraping jessmitchell.ca multiple times, refactor!)
3. class instance variable = weird (in a class method, having an @instance method that doesn't get "saved" properly)
4. don't have classes that never get properly instantiated
5. avoid hardcoded numbers when it can be made to vary. E.g. avoid using 10 instead of array.length in case the array changes
6. use "collect" instead of "each" if you're just pushing values into an array and returning that array (check if a method exists to simplify your code)
Basically, don't spread your data all over. Create classes to organize your data when needed.
