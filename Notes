Steps taken (started Friday, November 17th):

- bundle gem install to create new gem template
- created repo "is_it_poly-cli-app" (following Learn naming convention)
- small update to ReadMe to make sure repo is set up properly on GitHub and locally
- created lib/is_it_poly/cli.rb and updated lib/is_it_poly.rb so controller class is working (following the Learn video about this)
- updated bin/is_it_poly and tested controller class to make sure the basics are working so far (they are! :) )
