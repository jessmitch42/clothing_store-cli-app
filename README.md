# Clothing Store CLI Gem

Welcome to my Clothing Store CLI Gem!

Use this gem to explore women's clothing from different online stores before deciding if you want to purchase anything.

Other use cases: online shopping while you're writing a ruby gem.

I am currently featuring JCrew's tall women's line and SSENSE's women's clothing line. If you don't like either, you're out of luck. O:)

Enjoy!

## Usage

Fork, clone, 'ruby bin/clothing_store'

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
